		<p>Rachel Kory has been with Scovil Galen Ghosh Literary Agency, Inc. since 2011. She is a graduate of Mount Holyoke College, where she studied Classics and played rugby. Her love of violent sports has not waned: she is now an avid practitioner of muay thai. As an agent and digital strategist, Rachel is interested in all things new media; she works to integrate authors into an increasingly electronic world. As a lover of genre fiction and media, she is fascinated by the blurring of lines between fan and professional.
